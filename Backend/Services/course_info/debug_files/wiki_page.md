**Labs**

Labs and office hours start in week 2 of the semester (if you need anything before then, please ask on Piazza (link coming soon) or send me (Andi) an email, or better yet, talk to me after class, **at this point nothing is really so urgent that it cannot wait until after class**). If your friends are on the waitlist....instructors do not control enrollment, they will have to wait for a spot to open up in the existing two sections.

**Office** **hours for instructor and TAs**:  
Andi:    
   Monday: 1-2:30pm  
   Tuesday 9-10am and 3-4pm; (more can be added if needed, but that's it for now).

TAs: COMING SOON
