#### **More Details for Assessment and Deadlines**

The CSC301 project will be divided into multiple phases plus presentation via video submission. The mark allocation and required components of each phase will be specified in the project handout. The timeline for the project will stretch from week 2 to week 11, also this work is a team work. Specifically, students will perform their project related duties in a simulated work environment, where everyone can miss work for legitimate reasons. If any of the team members is unable to perform their duties due to illness or other legitimate reasons, the other team members need to fulfill their duties. Upon recovery the team member accommodated by others needs to perform extra duties to compensate those who helped them. Everyone is expected to act in a professional manner and cooperate with other team members as necessary in order to respect the deadlines.

There are 10 tutorials, where 4 tutorials will be dedicated to agile meetings tied to the project, and the other 6 tutorials will be dedicated to practicing new technologies needed for the CSC301 project; these 6 tutorials count towards your class participation and lab grade. The agile tutorial meetings are mandatory and the mark associated to those tutorials is part of the final project mark.

The students may work in pairs for their assignments. If a student is working alone and has documented reasons that render them unable to perform academic duties for the assignment period, they will be offered extensions at the discretion of the instructor, reducing the extension in case the student is working in a pair.

#### **Penalties for Lateness**

All deadlines are strict. Exceptions may be made at the discretion of the instructor for documented reasons. All work will be submitted electronically. Having technical problems, poor Internet connection, etc. will not be accepted as reasons for late submissions.

In case of illness or other exceptional circumstances, please email supporting documentation to your instructor and declare your absence on acorn. For the assignments student will be offered an extension to the discretion of the instructor. No extensions on project deliverables.

Missing the term test will result in an oral exam at a time and day set by the instructor.

Applicable to assignments only: Each student/pair will have a total of 5 grace tokens availble for the course. Each of these grace tokens is worth 3 hours and can be used for any, or both, of the two assignments providing a total maximum 15 additional hours during the entire course. Note, grace tokens are not applicable to any of the project or lab deliverables.

### **Procedures and Rules**

#### **Missed Term Work**

Once per semester, each student is allowed to miss work without any documentation. In that case you must fill out the ACORN absence declaration form. The form can be used at most ONCE per semester (once in total for all of your courses, not once per course). The absence you declare can be for a maximum of 7 consecutive days. If you use the ACORN absence declaration form, you do not need to submit any documentation for missed work during that absence.

For missed term work with valid documentation or declaration, your term work will be shifted to the remaining equivalent course components.

For missed assignments which you had a week or more to complete, no accommodations will be given, except if you have highly extenuating circumstances (for example if had to be hospitalized for a long period of time). This applies to any work for which you had more than a week to complete it.

Note: You should check all your course outlines carefully because different courses may have different policies.

Ideally, do not wait to contact your instructor until the due date has passed. It is always easier to make alternate arrangements well

before the due date.

#### **Academic Integrity**

Academic integrity is essential to the pursuit of learning and scholarship in a university, and to ensuring that a degree from the University of Toronto Mississauga is a strong signal of each student's individual academic achievement. As a result, UTM treats cases of cheating and plagiarism very seriously. The University of Toronto's Code of [Behaviour](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-behaviour-academic-matters-july-1-2019) on Academic Matters outlines behaviours that constitute academic dishonesty and the process for addressing academic offences. Potential offences include, but are not limited to:

In papers and assignments:

- 1. Using someone else's ideas or words without appropriate acknowledgement.
- 2. Submitting your own work in more than one course, or more than once in the same course, without the permission of the instructor.
- 3. Making up sources or facts.
- 4. Obtaining or providing unauthorized assistance on any assignment.

#### On tests and exams:

- 1. Using or possessing unauthorized aids.
- 2. Looking at someone else's answers during an exam or test.
- 3. Misrepresenting your identity.

#### In academic work:

- 1. Falsifying institutional documents or grades.
- 2. Falsifying or altering any documentation required, including (but not limited to) doctor's notes.

Keep in mind that the department uses software that compares programs for evidence of similar code. Below are some tips to help you avoid committing an academic offence, like plagiarism.

- Never look at another student's lab/assignment solution(s). Never show another student your lab/assignment solution. This applies to all drafts of a solution and to incomplete and even incorrect solutions.
- Keep discussions with other students focused on concepts and examples. Never discuss labs/assignments before the due date with anyone but your Instructors and your TAs.

Do not discuss your solution publicly on the discussion board or publicly in the lab rooms/office hours.

All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following procedures outlined in the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. If you have questions or concerns about what constitutes appropriate academic behaviour or appropriate research and citation methods, you are expected to seek out additional information on academic integrity from your instructor or from other [institutional](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/academic-integrity/students) resources.

Students may use artificial intelligence tools, including generative AI, in this course as a learning aid or to help produce assignments and project deliverables except for the following two components: presentation component, term test component . Students may not use generative AI for the project presentation component in this course; students may not use generative AI for the term test component. Students are ultimately accountable for the work they submit.

### **Plagiarism Detection**

Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to the University's plagiarism detection tool for a review of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the tool's reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University's use of this tool are described on the Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation web site [(https://uoft.me/pdt-faq](https://uoft.me/pdt-faq)).

Students may wish to opt out of using the plagiarism detection tool. In order to opt out, contact your instructor by email no later than two (2) weeks after the start of classes. If you have opted out, then specific information on an alternative method to submit your assignment can be found below.

### **Informed Consent – Email Lists**

As a student enrolled in this course, you understand that you are providing your implicit consent to be included in an email list for the department to send you non-essential information from time to time. If you do not wish to be included in such an email list, please request to be removed by contacting one of the Academic Advisors & Undergraduate Program Administrators. Their information can be found on the MCS Website Contact Us [page](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/math-cs-stats/contact-us) .

#### **Additional Information**

Course information, lecture notes, tutorial material, important announcements, etc. will be posted on quercus. It is your responsibility to visit it frequently. You are responsible for reading all announcements on quercus and on the discussion board; please check frequently You are encouraged to use the discussion board to discuss the course material, pose questions on the assignments, etc. Please refrain from posting partial or full solutions on the discussion board.

If a piece of work has been mis-marked you may request a re-mark via the method specified by the instructor. For a re-mark to succeed, you must clearly and concisely express what you believe was mis-marked. Be prepared for the entire work to be reevaluated and for the mark to be adjusted up or down after the re-evaluation. Remark request MUST be made within one week after the mark is made available. No re-mark request will be accepted after one week.

Course work is due before 11:55pm sharp on the specified date (as indicated on MarkUs).

Do not use another student's work. As a precaution, I suggest that you only discuss high level ideas with other students, or, in case of your team's work, with other team's members. You are not permitted to take any notes during these discussions, nor are you permitted to consult other students' work. Sharing your work with other students is a violation of this policy. If challenged by either a lab instructor or the instructor, you must be able to reproduce and explain any work you submit in an oral exam. Failure to observe this policy is an academic offence.

Last Date to drop course from Academic Record and GPA is March 10, 2025.

#### **Equity, Diversity and Inclusion**

The University of Toronto is committed to equity, human rights and respect for diversity. All members of the learning environment in this course should strive to create an atmosphere of mutual respect where all members of our community can express themselves, engage with each other, and respect one another's differences. U of T does not condone discrimination or harassment against any persons or communities.
